# hello-world
I am learning GitHub and this is my first repository.
I feel really good when I learn something new. its very exciting! And I will simply ignore the word "impossible", simply because my brain only can read or interpret this message as "POSSIBLE".
So, I'm taking this journey of learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and whatever I need to become a web developer. If you think you can help me to enjoy this jorney you are more than welcome to do.
